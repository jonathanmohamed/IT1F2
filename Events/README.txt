Guide to uploading new events:

When submitting a new story please make sure both the Dutch (eventNl.txt) and English (eventEn.txt) are updated. 
Do NOT change the name of the file. If you are getting an error please make sure both text files are present and 
correctly named. 

The first line in the text document will be the title. The third line will start the content till the third to 
last line and the last line will be the date. See below for an example

///////////START TEXT DOCUMENT///////////

[	your	]
[	content	]
[	here	]
[Keep this line empty]
[Put the date of the event here]
///////////END TEXT DOCUMENT///////////

To update to a new picture remove the old picture and put in the new one with the name event.jpg. Make sure the
picture is named correctly and in the correct format.
