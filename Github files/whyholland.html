					<p><b>We’ll give you 5 good reasons!</b></p><br>
					<p>1. Wide range of English programmes<br>
					Dutch universities offer the largest number of English-taught programmes in continental Europe.<br>
					More than 2,100 programmes are taught entirely in English. Also, 95% of the Dutch speak English,<br>
					so it’s easy to communicate in daily life.</p>
					<p>2. Good value for your money<br>
					The quality of Dutch institutions is well-recognised. The tuition fees and cost of living are<br>
					considerably lower than in English-speaking countries. The Dutch teaching style is interactive and<br>
					student-centred. You will develop valuable skills such as analysing, solving practical problems and creative thinking.</p>
					<p>3. Big international community<br>
					Holland’s many international students come from more than 160 different countries. Dutch society is diverse<br>
					and inclusive. It is strongly connected to other cultures, the business community and the world.<br>
					The Dutch are open-minded and direct, so it is easy to meet them and exchange ideas.</p>
					<p>4. Great place to live<br>
					Holland is one of the safest countries in the world, according to the 2018 Global Peace index and belongs <br>
					to the top 10 happiest countries in the world. Read more about the good Dutch standard of living in the OECD’s Better Life Index.<br>
					Holland has a rich history with historic cities and the highest museum density in the world.<br>
					Also, Holland is the gateway to Europe! In just three hours you can be in Paris. London and Berlin are just a five or six hour train ride away.</p>
					<p>5. Excellent career opportunities<br>
					Holland is the 18th largest economy in the world. Some of the world’s biggest multinationals, including Philips, Heineken, KLM,<br>
					Shell, ING and Unilever, are Dutch. Holland is a world leader in many areas of expertise, including agriculture, water management, art<br> 
					& design, logistics and sustainable energy.</p>
					<p>The Dutch government wants to attract knowledge and retain talent. International graduates can therefore apply for an orientation year. <br>
					This is a residence permit of one year to find a job, or start a business within three years of graduation. Join our Holland Alumni <br>
					network to increase your chances on the job market.</p>
