					If you’re heading to the Netherlands for school soon, or considering attending university in this small corner of Europe,<br/>
					you’ve probably asked yourself, How much is it going to cost to live there?. This is a huge question on your mind while <br/>
					applying to schools, and even after reading about it from many sources online, You still wasn’t sure how much it would be.<br/>
					<b>Rent: approximately &euros; 515 per month, utilities included</b>
					<br/>
					This will obviously be your biggest expense and it can vary a lot depending on where you live in the country and how lucky<br/>
					you get during your apartment search. One can spend upto 515 a month for a room in Amsterdam, but other people would pay less than<br/>
					400 and some would pay up to &euro; 700. Most people seem to pay between &euro; 425-500<br/>
					<b>Groceries: Approximately &euro; 100-125 a month</b>
					<br/>
					This amount of course can vary by person and where you choose to shop. I do shop at the cheapest option in my neighborhood,<br/>
					and because I’m pretty bad at cooking and don’t like to spend 45 minutes preparing food, I tend to make simple things.<br/>
					For instance, I buy the 1 kilo bag of spaghetti for 64 cents, instead of the nice name brand for double the price.<br/>
					Compared to some countries, these prices may seem normal, high or low. Compared to the US it’s a great deal.<br/>
					<b>Phone Bill: &euro; 22.48 a month</b>
					<br/>
					<b>Transportation: &euro; 25-50 a month</b>
					<br/>
					Get a bike and use it and this number can and will go down a lot. With a bike! It’s super easy and cheaper.<br/>
					<b>Health Insurance: 39.33 a month</b>
					<br/>
					<b>Total: About &euro; 750-800 euros a month</b>
					<br/>
					Keep in mind this is just for basic survival. You won’t live like a king on the above budget. You still need to buy clothes<br/>
					sometimes, or something for the apartment that might bring these amounts up a bit. I also go out with friends for food<br/>
					or drinks, which compared to grocery shopping is quite expensive. If you’re trying to be frugal, at least in Amsterdam,<br/>
					it would be hard to do it much cheaper than the above cost.
