							<p>The musical instrument making major studies the morphology of musical instruments in view of the
							construction, reconstruction and preservation of these fascinating artefacts. The programme wishes
							to counter the tendency towards uniformity and explore the limitless sound potential of acoustic 
							instruments.</p>
							<p>Through this work, the discipline makes valuable contributions to the performance practice of both
							old and new music. The bachelor programme introduces the students to different techniques through
							the making of rather straightforward instruments from various disciplines (e.g. the dulcimer,
							psalterium, Baroque guitar, viol, cornetto â€¦). Students can then gradually move towards a specialization
							in stringed, plucked, wind or keyboard instruments. Students learn to play instruments, and the instruments
							they make are also tested and assessed by students of music during the academic year, and by renowned
							musicians and professional instrument makers for the final exams.</p>
