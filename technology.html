				<p>The Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering (BSAE) program at AUAT equips students with skills to solve
					even the most complex challenges in design, propulsion, and systems for aircraft and/or supercraft. For more
					than 17 years, the Aerospace Engineering undergraduate program at Embry-Riddle has held the top ranking in the
					nation among schools whose highest degree is a bachelors, according to the Netherlands and World Reports
					Netherlands Best Colleges Guide.</p>
					<p>The prestige of this program doesn’t end there. Students benefit from the most modern, state of the art resources
					available today, the same tools in use by aerospace engineering professionals around the globe.No other Aerospace
					Engineering program in the Netherlands attracts more students.
					Students gain hands-on experience from the start, with opportunities to participate in various projects and competitions.
					The program offers the chance to learn real-world, on-the-job engineering principles practiced by global companies and
					government agencies, enabling students to build a professional network within their first year.</p>

				<p>The bachelor's program mechanical engineering is a multi-faceted, future-proof university program,
				during which you will learn to convert technical knowledge into practical solutions for today's problems.
				If you enjoy searching for engineering solutions for all sorts of contemporary problems and want to lay
				a broad foundation for this, Mechanical Engineering is probably right up your street. A mechanical engineer
				designs, improves and maintains machines, buildings or processes. Although mechanical engineering is one of
				the oldest disciplines, you will discover that today's modern technologies are all connected with, and depending
				on, mechanical engineering. As a mechanical engineer you may eventually find yourself in any of a wide range of
				sectors and positions, from civil and aeronautical engineering to biomedical sciences or nano-technology.</p>
